  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Browsable FE Schema Plugin: If enabled, lets editors insert an FE plugin which renders a cacheable, Twitter Bootstrap based Schema browsing utility. WARNING: to use this FE plugin you MUST INSTALL an additional extension: "vhs" - which is NOT DOCUMENTED AS DEPENDENCIES IN EM because it is only necessary if this plugin is enabled. The plugin takes the desired extension key from plugin.tx_schemaker.settings.extensionKey or the title (hint: not nav_title, not translated title) of the page on which the plugin is inserted, i.e. name the page "fluid" and the plugin renders a schema for EXT:fluid. You must also manually add TS plugin.tx_schemaker.view.templateRootPath = EXT:schemaker/Resources/Private/Templates/ before the plugin will render.
